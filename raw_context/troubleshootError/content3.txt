**Error:**
The error is occurring in the build.sh script when trying to build the wheel package. It is giving the following error:
```
error: invalid command 'bdist_wheel'
mv: cannot stat './dist/*.whl': No such file or directory
```

**Solution:**
To fix this error, you can follow these troubleshooting steps:

1. **Check setuptools Version:**
   Ensure that the `setuptools` package is up-to-date in your Python environment. Some older versions of `setuptools` do not support the `bdist_wheel` command.

2. **Install Wheel Package:**
   Make sure you have the `wheel` package installed in your virtual environment. You can install it using pip:
   ```
   pip install wheel
   ```

3. **Update setup.py:**
   Modify your `setup.py` file to explicitly enable the `bdist_wheel` command by adding the following line:
   ```python
   setup(
       ...
       setup_requires=['wheel'],
       ...
   )
   ```

4. **Run the Build Script:**
   After making the changes, try running the build script `build.sh` again. This should now recognize and execute the `bdist_wheel` command correctly.

5. **Verify Wheel Package:**
   Once the build script completes without errors, check the `wheel_dist` directory to ensure that the `.whl` file has been successfully created and moved there.

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the `invalid command 'bdist_wheel'` error and successfully build the wheel package for your project.
