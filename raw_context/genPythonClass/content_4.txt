Write python code that takes a directory containing json object and is able to return them as dictionaries. The code shall have two methods, one for retrieving a dictionary from a specific json and one to retrieve all names of available jsons. The class name shall be ContextManager and the class shall use ConversationJsonReader from ConversationJsonReader which I wrote to retrieve the JSON data.
