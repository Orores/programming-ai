Write python code that can read a json of the form:

    [
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {"role": "user", "content": "Hello, how are you?"}
    ]

Call the Class ConversationJsonReader and let it have two methods, one to read a json and return a dictionary and another one to validate that the json has the expected structure.
