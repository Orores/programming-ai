# ConversationPreparer Design

## Abstract
The `ConversationPreparer` class is designed to prepare conversation data for the chatbot. It can read the conversation data from a file or directly from a provided question. This class facilitates the conversion of string conversations into structured data and extends the conversation with additional context if necessary. Additionally, it supports reading the question from a file for scenarios where the question is long.

## Class Design

### Methods

1. **decide_conversation**
   - **Description**: Decides and retrieves the conversation data based on the provided file path, question, or question file path.
   - **Arguments**:
     - `file_path` (`str`, optional): The path to the file containing the conversation data. Default is `None`.
     - `question` (`str`, optional): The question to be used as conversation data. Default is `None`.
     - `question_file_path` (`str`, optional): The path to the file containing the question. Default is `None`.
   - **Returns**: 
     - `str` or `list`: The retrieved conversation data.

2. **str_to_dict_list**
   - **Description**: Converts a string conversation into a list of dictionaries with role and content.
   - **Arguments**:
     - `conversation` (`str` or `list`): The conversation data as a string or a list of dictionaries.
   - **Returns**: 
     - `list`: The conversation data as a list of dictionaries.

3. **extend_context**
   - **Description**: Extends the given conversation with additional context data if available.
   - **Arguments**:
     - `context_name` (`str`, optional): The name of the context to be appended. Default is `None`.
     - `conversation` (`list`): The conversation data as a list of dictionaries.
   - **Returns**: 
     - `list`: The extended conversation data with additional context.

### Error Handling

- **decide_conversation**
  - **FileNotFoundError**: Raised if the specified file path or question file path does not exist.

- **str_to_dict_list**
  - **TypeError**: Raised if the conversation data is not of type `str` or `list`.

### How it Works

1. **decide_conversation**:
   - Step 1: If a file path is provided, attempt to read the conversation data from the file using `ConversationJsonReader` or `StringFileReader`.
   - Step 2: If a question file path is provided, read the question from the file.
   - Step 3: If a question is provided, use it as the conversation data.
   - Step 4: If neither is provided, raise an error or prompt the user for input.
   - Step 5: Return the conversation data.

2. **str_to_dict_list**:
   - Step 1: Check if the conversation data is of type `str`. If so, convert it into a list of dictionaries with role and content.
   - Step 2: If the conversation data is already a list, return it as is.

3. **extend_context**:
   - Step 1: If a context name is provided, load the context data using `ContextManager`.
   - Step 2: Append the loaded context data to the existing conversation data.
   - Step 3: Return the extended conversation data.

### Class Paradigm

- The class follows a utility pattern with static methods.
- Each method has a single responsibility.
- Includes comprehensive docstrings.

### Testing Strategy

- **Test `decide_conversation`**:
  - Verify that conversation data is correctly read from a file.
  - Verify that conversation data is correctly set from the provided question.
  - Verify that conversation data is correctly set from the provided question file path.
  - Verify that an error is raised if neither file path nor question nor question file path is provided.

- **Test `str_to_dict_list`**:
  - Verify that a string conversation is correctly converted into a list of dictionaries.
  - Verify that a list conversation is returned as is.
  - Verify that an error is raised if the conversation data is not of type `str` or `list`.

- **Test `extend_context`**:
  - Verify that the conversation data is correctly extended with additional context data.
  - Verify that the method handles cases where no context name is provided.
  - Verify that an error is raised if the context data cannot be loaded.

### Example Usage

```python
from AutoChatBot.ConversationPreparer import ConversationPreparer

# Example 1: Decide conversation from a file
conversation = ConversationPreparer.decide_conversation(file_path="path/to/conversation.json")

# Example 2: Decide conversation from a question
conversation = ConversationPreparer.decide_conversation(question="What is the purpose of this code?")

# Example 3: Decide conversation from a question file
conversation = ConversationPreparer.decide_conversation(question_file_path="path/to/question.txt")

# Example 4: Convert string conversation to list of dictionaries
conversation_list = ConversationPreparer.str_to_dict_list("What is the purpose of this code?")

# Example 5: Extend conversation with additional context
extended_conversation = ConversationPreparer.extend_context("context_name", conversation_list)
```
