# MultiFileAgent Design

## Abstract
The `MultiFileAgent` class is designed to facilitate the generation of multiple files using the AutoChatbot. It leverages reference files and rewrite files to create a comprehensive prompt, generate content for the rewrite files, and return a dictionary with the new content for each rewrite file.

## Class Design

### Methods

1. **generate_file_strings**
   - **Description**: Generates strings representing the contents of reference and rewrite files.
   - **Arguments**:
     - `reference_files` (`list`): List of paths to the reference files.
     - `rewrite_files` (`list`): List of paths to the rewrite files.
   - **Returns**:
     - `str`: Concatenated string of all reference file contents.
     - `str`: Concatenated string of all rewrite file contents.

2. **create_base_prompt**
   - **Description**: Creates the base prompt string by concatenating the reference file string, rewrite file string, and task string.
   - **Arguments**:
     - `reference_files` (`list`): List of paths to the reference files.
     - `rewrite_files` (`list`): List of paths to the rewrite files.
     - `question` (`str`): The question to be included in the task string.
   - **Returns**:
     - `str`: The base prompt string.

3. **generate_content_for_rewrite_files**
   - **Description**: Iteratively generates content for each rewrite file using the AutoChatbot.
   - **Arguments**:
     - `base_prompt_string` (`str`): The base prompt string.
     - `rewrite_files` (`list`): List of paths to the rewrite files.
   - **Returns**:
     - `dict`: Dictionary with file paths as keys and generated content as values.

4. **execute**
   - **Description**: Orchestrates the entire process of generating content for rewrite files and returns the final dictionary.
   - **Arguments**:
     - `reference_files` (`list`): List of paths to the reference files.
     - `rewrite_files` (`list`): List of paths to the rewrite files.
     - `question` (`str`): The question to be included in the task string.
   - **Returns**:
     - `dict`: Dictionary with file paths as keys and generated content as values.

### Error Handling

- **generate_file_strings**
  - **FileNotFoundError**: Raised if any reference file does not exist.
  - **IOError**: Raised if there is an issue reading the files.

- **create_base_prompt**
  - **ValueError**: Raised if the question is not provided.

### How it Works

1. **generate_file_strings**:
   - Step 1: Read the contents of each reference file and concatenate them into a single string.
   - Step 2: Check if each rewrite file exists. If not, create it and its parent directories if necessary.
   - Step 3: Read the contents of each rewrite file and concatenate them into a single string.

2. **create_base_prompt**:
   - Step 1: Generate the reference file string and rewrite file string.
   - Step 2: Create the task string using the provided question.
   - Step 3: Concatenate the reference file string, rewrite file string, and task string to form the base prompt string.

3. **generate_content_for_rewrite_files**:
   - Step 1: Iterate over each file in the rewrite file list.
   - Step 2: Append the appropriate prompt to the base prompt string for each file.
   - Step 3: Use the ChatAPIHandler to generate content for each file.
   - Step 4: Filter the content if the file is a Python file.
   - Step 5: Store the generated content in a dictionary and append it to the prompt string.

4. **execute**:
   - Step 1: Call `create_base_prompt` to generate the base prompt string.
   - Step 2: Call `generate_content_for_rewrite_files` to generate the content for each rewrite file.
   - Step 3: Return the final dictionary with the generated content.

### Class Paradigm

- The class follows an orchestrator pattern where the `execute` method coordinates the entire process.
- Includes robust error handling to ensure reliable file operations.
- Modular design with each method having a single responsibility.

### Testing Strategy

- **Test `generate_file_strings`**:
  - Verify that the method correctly concatenates the contents of reference and rewrite files.
  - Verify that the method handles the creation of non-existent rewrite files.

- **Test `create_base_prompt`**:
  - Verify that the base prompt string is correctly generated using the reference file string, rewrite file string, and task string.
  - Verify that the method handles missing questions appropriately.

- **Test `generate_content_for_rewrite_files`**:
  - Verify that the method correctly generates content for each rewrite file.
  - Verify that the method handles Python file content filtering correctly.

- **Test `execute`**:
  - Verify that the method orchestrates the steps correctly and returns the expected dictionary.
  - Include tests that mock the API as well as tests that make actual API calls to ensure the system's integrity.
